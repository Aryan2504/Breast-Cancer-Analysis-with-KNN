# Breast-Cancer-Analysis-with-KNN

This GitHub repository showcases an in-depth analysis of a breast cancer dataset utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm. The project begins by leveraging the Scikit-learn library to load the dataset. The dataset is then preprocessed by splitting it into training and testing sets. Additionally, the features are scaled using the StandardScaler technique. The KNN classifier is trained on the training set, with a default train-test ratio of 75:25.

To evaluate the performance of the classifier, various metrics are employed. These include a confusion matrix, ROC curve, scatter plot, and histogram, which aid in visualizing the data and understanding the classifier's effectiveness. Furthermore, the project incorporates a loop that analyzes the classifier for different train-test ratios, allowing the calculation of performance metrics such as specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision, and F1-score.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a KNN-based classification model for detecting breast cancer and assess its performance using diverse performance metrics. By exploring this repository, you will gain insights into breast cancer analysis and the application of KNN classification, enhancing your understanding of the field.
